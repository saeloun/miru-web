Warning from shoulda-matchers:

You are using `validate_inclusion_of` to assert that a boolean column
allows boolean values and disallows non-boolean ones. Be aware that it
is not possible to fully test this, as boolean columns will
automatically convert non-boolean values to boolean ones. Hence, you
should consider removing this test.
