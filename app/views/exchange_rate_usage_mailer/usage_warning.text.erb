⚠️ Exchange Rate API Usage Warning

Hello <%= @user.first_name.presence || 'Admin' %>,

Your Open Exchange Rates API usage has reached <%= @percentage %>% of the monthly free tier limit.

CURRENT USAGE STATISTICS:
- Current Usage: <%= @usage.requests_count %> / <%= ExchangeRateUsage::FREE_TIER_LIMIT %> requests
- Percentage Used: <%= @percentage %>%
- Remaining Requests: <%= @remaining %>
- Month: <%= @usage.month.strftime('%B %Y') %>
- Last Updated: <%= @usage.last_fetched_at&.strftime('%B %d, %Y at %I:%M %p') || 'N/A' %>

WHAT HAPPENS IF THE LIMIT IS EXCEEDED?
- The system will stop fetching new exchange rates
- Existing cached rates will continue to be used
- Invoice creation will still work with the last known rates

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
- Monitor your usage for the rest of the month
- Consider upgrading to a paid plan if you need more requests
- Review which currency pairs are actively being used
- The limit resets on the 1st of next month
