#### Dependencies
- **Some peer dependencies** have version requirement updates
- **Build tools** require updated configuration for custom setups
- **Testing framework** migration from legacy specs to Playwright recommended

### üöÄ **Migration Guide**

#### For Developers
1. **Update local environment**:
   ```bash
   # Update Node.js to v22 LTS
   nvm install 22
   nvm use 22

   rbenv install 3.4.5
   rbenv local 3.4.5
   
   # Install dependencies
   pnpm install
   bundle install
   ```

2. **Development workflow changes**:
   - Use `bin/vite dev` instead of legacy webpack dev server
