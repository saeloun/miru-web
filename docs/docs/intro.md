# Introduction

Welcome to **Miru** ‚Äî a modern, open-source time tracking and invoicing platform built for the way teams work today. Whether you're a freelancer managing multiple clients, an agency tracking billable hours, or a distributed team coordinating across time zones, Miru provides the tools you need to manage time, projects, and payments efficiently.

## Why Miru?

In today's fast-paced business environment, effective time management isn't just about tracking hours ‚Äî it's about understanding productivity, optimizing workflows, and ensuring accurate billing. Miru addresses these needs with a comprehensive yet intuitive platform that scales with your business.

  project: project,
  duration: 2.hours,

)
```

#### **Built for Collaboration**
Modern work is collaborative. Miru facilitates seamless communication between team members, project managers, and clients through shared dashboards, real-time updates, and transparent reporting.

As an open-source Rails application, Miru is built by developers, for developers. Extend it, customize it, or contribute back to the community.
