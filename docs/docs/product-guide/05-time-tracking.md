Miru Time Tracking tab offers three distinct perspectives: Month, Week, and Day views.

In the Day view, you have the ability to append notes to your time entries, making it especially handy for real-time time tracking while you're working.

The Week view streamlines the process of entering a substantial amount of time all at once, eliminating the need to navigate to individual days. This feature proves beneficial when you need to record time across multiple days simultaneously.

Lastly, the Month view provides a comprehensive snapshot of your entire month, displaying an overview of your work hours.
