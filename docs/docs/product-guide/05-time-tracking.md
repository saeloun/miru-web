Miru Time Tracking tab offers three distinct perspectives: Month, Week, and Day views.

In the Day view, you have the ability to append notes to your time entries, making it especially handy for real-time time tracking while you're working.

The Week view streamlines the process of entering a substantial amount of time all at once, eliminating the need to navigate to individual days. This feature proves beneficial when you need to record time across multiple days simultaneously.

Lastly, the Month view provides a comprehensive snapshot of your entire month, displaying an overview of your work hours.

# Day View

The Day view of your timesheet lets you track your time as you work. By adding entries for work you've already done, you can make sure your time is accurate and accounted for.

You can access this view by going to **Time Tracking > DAY**.

## Logging Time Off

In addition to tracking work hours, you can also log time off (leave) entries:

1. Click to add a new entry
2. Select a leave type from the dropdown - this includes:
   - **Standard leave types** (e.g., PTO, Sick Leave) - available to all employees
   - **Custom leaves** - special allocations assigned specifically to you
3. Enter the duration and select the date
4. Add optional notes
5. Save the entry

Your leave balance will automatically update to reflect the time off taken. For more details on leave management, see the [Leave Management guide](./team/leave-management).

# Week View

The Weekly Overview of your timesheet provides an efficient way to input a significant amount of time at once. You can access this overview by navigating to **Time Tracking > WEEK**.

Here, you can easily track your total hours worked.

### Adding Time in the Weekly Overview

1. Start by clicking on **Add Row**.
2. Choose your client and project, then click **Save Row**. You can expedite this process by typing the names and pressing the **Enter** key.
3. Enter your time in the newly added row. To save it, simply click the **Save** button. If you need to provide additional details, select the individual entry to highlight it and add a description. To indicate whether an entry is billable or non-billable, toggle the "Billable" checkbox.

# Month View

The Month view of your timesheet provides an efficient way to view all hours logged at glance. You can access this overview by navigating to **Time Tracking > MONTH**.

Here, you can easily track your total hours worked for the month.

### Adding Time in the Monthly Overview
