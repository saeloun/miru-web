orem Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.

# Invoice Email Design Fix
- Did research to find the leading cause of design not being proper. it turned out it was due to the fact the emails don't support a lot of CSS properties which we were using in the email layout, primarily being Display: Flex
- Design the layout using tables and float property. as most email clients support them
- Another Problem faced was in the case of Gmail. The Icons weren't displaying because we were using SVG icons.
- Fixed by converting the SVG Icons to PNG images and using them instead of SVG in email templates.

Problem:-

Currently, suppose Amazon Rekognition returns status as FAILED for the scanned video. In that case, the video again gets added to the unprocessed_medias list in Redis and when FetchMediaScanStatusJob gets run, it iterates over the unprocessed_medias list and again unnecessarily fetches the status for the failed video.

Solution:-

We can mark the status of the video as FAILED and remove it from the unprocessed_medias list.",Murtaza Bagwala,06.10.2022,10:00
Seeef,Seeef,"Worked on fixing all the deprecated warnings in the system.
So, the major one was this ""Redis.current= is deprecated and will be removed in 5.0."". So we were instantiating Redis like this 

Redis.current = Redis.new(REDIS_URL)

And, according to the warning with version 5, we'll be not allowed to do this.

In order to fix this, I had a couple of approaches like using a global variable or monkey patching the Redis.rb but, finally, I created customized RedisPool class and abstracted all the Redis calls inside it and raised the PR.

# Invoice Email Design Fix
- The Invoice emails look perfect on letter opener but the layout is not proper when we see on real email client (gmail)
- Setup Mailer to sent emails locally
    Problem Faced during setup
      - Puppeteer was not able to open chrome and it was throwing the exception. Did the research and made some local changes.
      - Emails were getting dispatch and a letter opener  was getting opened but not able to receive  emails. I tried changing the mode to SMTP and setup to use my personal gmail to sent emails. It create another Issue as I was not able to authenticate my gmail on research found out Google after March 2022 stopped letting user authenticate using third party just with credential. Instead of solving google auth I used SENDGRID and it worked.(I was able to sent emails at this point).

Blog,HR,"I picked up this blog to write https://github.com/saeloun/blog/issues/1052
Rails multi database: define reading_request? in resolver. So, the idea of this blog was to show how Rails allows overriding the reading_request? method from DatabaseSelector::Resolver to add our own custom logic.

In order to understand this, I tried creating a sample app with multiple databases and then was setting up the Graphql API with rails for that I explored https://graphql-ruby.org/.

So, what I was trying to do is to redirect read (GET) requests to the replica database and write(POST/PUT) to write database but Graphql uses POST for read and write both. So, to fix this I overrode the reading_request? method and added my own custom logic like this

def reading_request?(request)
  graphql_read = request.post? && request.path == ""/graphql"" && !request.params[:query]&.include?(""mutation"")

  graphql_read || super
end

Then used the custom resolver in an initializer

config.active_record.database_selector = { delay: 2.seconds }
config.active_record.database_resolver = CustomResolver
