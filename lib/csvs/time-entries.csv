- Handle all email related authentication flow along with edge cases
- Created custom email_confirmations_controller.rb to handle email resend if the user didn't confirmed the mail ID. Added custom routes to internal api and client side auth requests.
- After signup if unconfirmed user tried to signin, system will sign the user but it will display the popup saying that please confirm the mail id to continue with resend button .
- Fixed existing bug on the user model where for unconfirmed user it will show a toastr message saying that you are not authenticated user.
In the custom session controller we are going to login as the api and its upto the client to decide what to the logged user even if he is unconfirmed.
- Updated the user context and email confirmation component accordingly.

- Fixed entries & calendar mismatch bug on time tracking when changing months.
- Before, we showed the monthly calendar along with entries based on first-day value. eg: In 2023, Feb 1st & March 1st are on Wednesday. In the codebase, the entries & calendar are refreshed based on useEffect depending on the first day. We never noticed this bug as we have never seen the first day falls on the same day for consecutive months. But this year 2023 it happened for Feb & March months as the first day of both months falls on Wednesday.

- Tried 3 approaches laid out by buildkite to troubleshoot docker
* Change the way permissions are set on the files created by your Docker container: modify your container's USER or modify your build commands.
* Configure user namespace remapping on your Docker host to ensure that container users are remapped to the same user running your buildkite-agent.
* Run a script before or after builds that resets permissions. You can do this either using Docker (because it runs as root) or using sudo. See the Buildkite Elastic CI Stack for AWS's fix-buildkite-agent-builds-permissions script or the sudoers.conf script for examples of using an agent hook and sudo command to reset permissions.
